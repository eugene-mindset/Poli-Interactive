## Deliverables

All deliverables asked of us are included in this zip.

## Issues

Our data had to be pulled from APIs which return results that weren't table-like.
To make it table like, the XML files were scraped and the data was inserted into SQL directly, then
pulled out as CSVs Data from multiple sites and APIs had to be merged together.

## Concerns

None.
